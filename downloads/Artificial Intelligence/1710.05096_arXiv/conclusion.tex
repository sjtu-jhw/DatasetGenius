\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented a general ontology design pattern for trees together with an axiomatization which makes it possible to answer non-trivial competency questions as they arise in practice. We have also presented a list pattern derived from this tree pattern. We have furthermore discussed limitations of OWL for the modeling of trees, and have provided an alternative axiomatization for the more specific case that the tree is known to be $n$-bounded.

Of course, our approach is still rather straightforward and there exist cases where our model will not suffice. For example, in the application domain discussed in Section \ref{sec:trees-of-life}, it is often desirable to attach additional information to parent-child relationships (i.e., edges), e.g. temporal information. This cannot be done in our current model but would require a reification of the edges using established techniques, and of course this change may affect the treatment of our competency questions. This remains to be investigated.
