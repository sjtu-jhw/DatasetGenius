\section{Conclusion}
Speculative decoding's efficiently hinges on the draft model's approximation to the target model.
We introduce an online speculative method that continuously enhances the draft model based on varying data distributions. Experiments on both synthetic and real data demonstrate that online speculative decoding swiftly adapts to new data distributions, significantly enhancing token acceptance.
