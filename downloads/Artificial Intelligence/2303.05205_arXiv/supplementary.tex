\subsubsection*{Action space formulation}
As shown in Extended Table.2, the action space is a dictionary of the upper boundaries and lower boundaries of generators' output power. For thermal generators, their upper bounds and lower bounds are determined as $[-\text{p}_\text{ramp}, \text{p}_\text{ramp}]$. For renewable generators, since their output power could be set as $[0,\overline{\text{p}}]$ at each step, their upper bounds and lower bounds are $[-\text{p}, \overline{\text{p}}-\text{p}]$.

\subsubsection*{Rules of GridSim}
\paragraph{The upper and lower limits of the active output of the unit} The active power of any unit (except the balancing unit) cannot be greater than the upper limit of the active power, nor can it be smaller than the lower limit of the active power. If it is violated, the emulator prompts "illegal action", forcibly ending the episode.

\paragraph{Maximum output constraint of new energy units} 
In any time step, the active power output of renewable energy units cannot be greater than the maximum power generation capability. If it is violated, the emulator prompts "illegal action", forcibly ending the round.

\paragraph{Unit ramping constraint} The active power adjustment of any thermal power unit must be smaller than the ramping rate. If it is violated, the emulator prompts "illegal action", forcibly ending the episode.

\paragraph{Unit startup/shutdown constraints} The shutdown rule for thermal power units is that the active power output of the unit must be adjusted to the lower bound before the unit is shutdown, and then adjusted to 0. Restarting is not allowed within 40 consecutive steps after the unit is stopped. The startup rule of thermal power units is that the active power output must be adjusted to the lower bound before the unit is turned on. No shutdown is allowed for 40 consecutive time steps after the unit is restarted.

\paragraph{Line overflow constraint} If the line current exceeds the limit but does not exceed 135\% of the thermal limit, it means that the branch is "soft overloaded". If the line current exceeds 135\% of the thermal regulation limit, it means the line is "hard overloaded". If any line has "soft overload" for 4 consecutive time steps, the line will be shut down. In the event of a "hard overload", the line is immediately shut down. After the line has been out of service for 16 time steps, it will be put into operation again.

\paragraph{Upper and lower limit constraints of the unit's reactive power output} When the agent adjusts the voltage at the machine terminal, the unit's reactive power output value exceeds its upper and lower limits, and a negative reward will be obtained.
\paragraph{Voltage upper and lower limit constraints} If the node voltage exceeds its upper and lower limits, it will get a negative reward.

\paragraph{Upper and lower limit constraints of the balancing machine} The system sets a balancing unit to share the unbalanced power of the system caused by the unreasonable control strategy. After the power flow calculation, if the active power output of the balancing unit is greater than the upper limit but less than 110\% of the upper limit, or less than the lower limit but greater than 90\% of the lower limit, a negative reward will be obtained. If the output is greater than 110\% of the upper limit or less than 90\% of the lower limit, the episode ends.

\subsubsection*{Training statistics}
As shown in Extended Fig.1, GridZero much outperforms SAC, which shows the superiority of planning over the actor-critic framework in terms of policy improvement. All experiments are done on a machine with 8 Nvidia RTX-2080Ti GPUs and 80 cores of Intel Xeon Gold 5218R CPU.

Moreover, Extended Fig.1 and Extended Fig.2 both show that GridZero is highly sample-efficient that it only requires 1 million environmental interaction steps and 15-kilo training steps.
