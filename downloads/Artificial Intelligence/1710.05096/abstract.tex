\begin{abstract}
Trees -- i.e., the type of data structure known under this name -- are central to many aspects of knowledge organization. We investigate some central design choices concerning the ontological modeling of such trees. In particular, we consider the limits of what is expressible in the Web Ontology Language, and provide a reusable ontology design pattern for trees.
